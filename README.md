# domevents

I saw comments below the lecture about how discouraging it is for this exercise to not have a solution video. At first, I thought to myself this is impossible. But when sat down and compare other's solutions, tried to understand the element class and event reference they used, I got it. 

This is what I asked myself:
1. What does this line of code mean? Which part of this piece is an object, an element class, or an event reference? 
2. What does this function accept? What does it return? What change does this code make? What is going on? console.log() it.
3. Would one's code work together with someone else's? Is it syntactic difference or logic difference? Is there another way I can do this?
4. Is there anything that repeats? Can I put it in a function, give it a name, and reuse the code?

Hope this helps.
